\section{Implementation}
The simulation is split into several function files. The main file, where the
whole simulation is running, is the \textit{simulation.m}. This file needs
some information of the room, the walls and doors, the agents and so on to
run. What it exactly needs, can be looked up in the comment of the file.
To run some different kinds of simulation, we provide with the code some
\textit{initX.m} ($X \in 1\ldots5$) which construct different examples of
rooms and place the people at random positions. For an example of a running
matlab script please have a look at the first element in appendix A.

\subsection{Time Integration}
For the time integration we do an simple explicit euler. This means that we
integrate according to the following scheme: 
\[v_{i+1} = v_i + \delta t \cdot a_i \]
\[x_{i+1} = x_i + \delta t \cdot v_{i+1}\]
The $a$ is calculated as it was shown in the introduction of this report: 
\[ a = \frac{\delta^2 x_p}{\delta t^2}  = \frac{1}{m} \left( - \sum^{N}_{q = 1, q \neq p}
\nabla_{x_p} V_{agent}(|x_p - x_q|) - \nabla_{x_p} V_{door}(|x_p - x_q|) 
- \sum^{W}_{q = 1} \nabla_{x_p} V_{wall}(|x_p - x_q|)\right)\]
