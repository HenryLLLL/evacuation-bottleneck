\section{Introduction and Motivations} 
People tend to form a crowd in states of emergency. The typical flight
behaviour is moving away from the source of danger. In open space people would
diffuse in all directions but if there are boundaries like walls or a street
the only way out is an exit. Usually, exits are small in comparison to the
crowd so the flow of people through the exit will be larger than the exit's
capacity. The result manifests itself as a bottleneck. The typical appearance
of a bottleneck is a semi-circular crowd around the exit. The main objective
of every evacuation plan is a sufficient amount of exits which are well
distributed so that the crowd splits up in smaller crowds. The interesting
point here is that the crowd will not spread evenly because of the individual and
collective behaviour of human beings.  People tend to head towards known and
visible exits which aren't crowded. This preference for a specific exit may
change depending on the circumstances. Our simulation is focused on how people
chose an exit and how this decision affects the collective behaviour.

\section{Description of the Model}
\subsection{Model Overview} 

This section is a brief description of the model we implemented. We have
chosen a continous model for our simulation. The benefit of a continuous
simulation is that infinitesimal movements are possible and we think, it
shows the movement of people in a more natural way. 

The room is a two dimensional space, which includes three different types of
agents. The first are the people, which need to be evacuated, and the second
are the wall elements. The third kind are the door agents, which define a door.
The big difference between the three kinds, is that the door and wall
agents can not move.
The agents on the other side, need to move, so that they can get out of the
room. They move according to potentials, in whose radius they are. Since we
are working with potential fields, the agents want to go into the direction of
the negative gradient of the sum of all fields. This is mathematically
described as:

\[ m\frac{\delta^2 x_p}{\delta t^2}  = - \sum^{N}_{q = 1, q \neq p}
\nabla_{x_p} V_{agent}(|x_p - x_q|) - \nabla_{x_p} V_{door}(|x_p - x_q|) 
- \sum^{W}_{q = 1} \nabla_{x_p} V_{wall}(|x_p - x_q|)\]
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V_{agent}$ \ldots potential-field of other people.	
	\item $V_{wall}$ \ldots potential-field of wall elements.
	\item $V_{door}$ \ldots potential-field of the door, an agent is heading
	for.
\end{itemize}
Since the wall and door elements do not move, they build a static field
together. The dynamic part of the field comes from the moving people.
Each person in the room induces a field, that repels the other agents. So this
one has a strong influence on how the people move in the room.
In other words, the doors and walls introduce a static field on the whole
room, and the people a dynamic field. This allows us to simulate realistic
escape dynamics.

The model is chosen according to a homework from the lecture \textit{Simulations
using Particles} by Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos.

It is known, that people try to follow each others, as long as there is a
constant flow. Once the flow stagnates, it is a matter of patience before
people start to panic. In this situation people push each other towards the
exit, trying to get out of the room. Instead of moving on faster this
behaviour will cause clogging. If this happens people on the margin of the
crowd will perhaps reconsider their decision an move away from the crowded
exit to an uncrowded one, even if the door was familiar to them. In conclusion
this means people will follow only moving people.

In our model, the people choose their door according to some game theoretical
approach \cite{BestResponseDynamics}. The agents will calculate the opportunity costs of each exit by
weighting the queue in front of the door, the distance to the door and
individual preference factors like familiarity and visibility of the door. The
individual preference factors and velocities are distributed randomly on
initialization.

\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
The basic configuration of the simulation consists of a square room with a
side length of ten units. There are three evenly spread exits, located on the
west side. The exits are all of the same width and a capacity of one agent
per timestep. The simulation has two scenarios, the first one is an empty room
without any obstacles and the second scenario uses the same room geometry but
there is a pile in the front of every door. The piles are modelled as square
blocks with a sidelength of one unit. They use the same repulsive force as the
wall does. (see figure \ref{rooms})

There are five cases with 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 agents. Every test case
consists of twelve runs. The average of these twelve runs will be used in the
analysis.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../graphen/raum_ohne_piles.jpg}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../graphen/raum_mit_piles.jpg}
	\caption{The rooms with and without piles used in the simulation.}
	\label{rooms}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Exit Time Comparison}
We see some differences between the two room configurations. In the
configuration with the piles, it takes longer until the people start to
leave the room. We think the reason may be that everybody has a direct way
to the doors and the doors are visible to all if there are no piles. This
means if the door is in sight, the people can estimate the queueing time so 
they are able to choose the door with best response in the first place.
By having piles, the people only know the route to doors they are familiar to.
If people get behind the piles all doors are in the line of sight. This means
the possibilites of choosing an exit expands rapidly and the frequency of 
redicisions increases. An other explanation for the slower evacuation in
the pile scenario may be that the pressure on the doors is lower. This causes
a smaller force acting on the people which results in a slower evacuation.
In figure \ref{noPileTimes} and \ref{pileTimes} one can see the number of people in the room versus
the time.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../graphen/agents_ohne_piles.png}
	\caption{Exit times for different numbers of people in the room without
	piles}
	\label{noPileTimes}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../graphen/agents_mit_piles.png}
	\caption{Exit times for different numbers of people in the room with piles}
	\label{pileTimes}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Decisions}
We also have some plots were one can see, how many people changed their mind
per timestep. Here we can see a big difference between the two room
configurations. When we have piles, the number of people changing the door is
much smaller then without the piles but it goes much longer until we have a
small number of redecisions (figure \ref{noPileDecision} and \ref{pileDecision}).
We think this makes perfectly sense, since due to the exit selection we
implemented, a person which does not know something about a door and does not
see it, would not go to that door even if it was nearest. We think this is how
people would act in reality too.

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../graphen/decisions_ohne_piles_2.png}
	\caption{Number of redecisions of persons in the room without piles}
	\label{noPileDecision}
\end{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../graphen/decisions_mit_piles_2.png}
	\caption{Number of redecisions of persons in the room with piles}

\end{figure}

\section{Summary and Outlook}
A continuous model for evacuation scenarios was implemented. By running the
software, we get some charactersitics of the crowd, which also happen in
reality. Additionally, the choosing of the door was done by best response
dynamics. Which is a game theoretical approach. 
The implemented model shows crowd characteristics, such as the circular form of the
crowd in front of a door, the redecition of the preferred door of people in
the crowd and more.

For further work, one could possibly implement the model with different
potential fields instead of the ones used. Also one could extend the static
fields in such a way, that the geometry can be more complex then it is in our
cases.

As a comparison, one could take the results from social experiments \cite{LianaManukyan} for
choosing the door and look if they give the same result. One example of such
an experiment gave the following evacuation strategies:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item I escaped according to the signs and instructions, and also
	broadcast or guide by shop-girls (46.7\%). 
	\item I chose the opposite direction to the smoking area to escape from
	the fire as soon as possible (26.3\%).
	\item I used the door because it was the nearest one (16.7\%).
	\item I just followed the other persons (3.0\%).
	\item I avoided the direction where many other persons go (3.0\%).
	\item There was a big window near the door and you could see outside. It
	was the most "bright" door, so I used it (2.3\%).
	\item I chose the door which I am used to (1.7\%).
\end{enumerate}
